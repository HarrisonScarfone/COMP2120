# Coursework for COMP 2120

Hey guys, this is my course work for COMP 2120, Introduction to Object Oriented Programming in Java. 

All assignments and labs received full marks, hopefully this can help some people with learning Java!

## IDE Used for Course

I used Eclipse IDE on a Linux machine.  It was just an easy solution to keeping a uniform workspace for one specific class (school class XD, but pun intended).

Eclipse also offers a window building utility, which allowed me to quickly develop them GUIs to get them bonus marks.
