# Coursework for COMP 2120

Hey guys, this is my course work for COMP 2120, Introduction to Object Oriented Programming in Java. 

All assignments and labs received full marks, hopefully this can help some people with learning Java!

## Disclaimer

This is not meant to facilitate cheating in the slightest however it is meant to give insight into problems by seeing how other people approach them!

## IDE Used for Course

I used Eclipse IDE on a Linux machine.  It was just an easy solution to keeping a uniform workspace for one specific class (school class XD, but pun intended).

Eclipse also offers a window building utility, which allowed me to quickly develop them GUIs to get them bonus marks.

## Running the Code

You can pull the whole repo and use in eclipse if you want a quick way to run/test/explore my code but check /src for each individual lab/assignment.
